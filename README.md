Smart Contracts

By using constructors, it is possible to select the adresses the payment is going to, without the need to have it hard coded. It is a very useful feature to end user. 

Using this contract, it is possible to control how much it is being sent and how much each recepient is getting. By using msg.value, it is possible to set the transaction in a way each account gets one third of the deposit amount.
